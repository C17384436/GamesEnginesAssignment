**Proposal Idea**: Within this assignment, I would like to create a game in which the user takes control of a serpent-like dragon. In this game, you control some movements for the dragon and as you fly through the sky, an infinite procedurally generated range of mountains continues on both sides with the same happening underneath but including trees and rivers.
